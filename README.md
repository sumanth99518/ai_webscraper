# WEB_SCRAPER_AI
An intelligent web scraper powered by LLMs that extracts clean, structured data from any website or uploaded HTML file — just by describing what you want.

##Overview

AI Web Scraper is a smart, user-friendly web app that combines web scraping, DOM parsing, and AI-driven data extraction into one seamless workflow.

You can provide:

A URL to scrape, or

An HTML file to upload

Then, describe the type of data you want — and the scraper automatically extracts relevant, structured information (CSV, JSON, etc.) using local or API-based Large Language Models (like Ollama, OpenRouter, or OpenAI).
-URL & HTML Input – Scrape live websites or upload local HTML files

-AI-Powered Data Extraction – Describe what you want in plain English

-Content Cleaning – Removes ads, scripts, sidebars, and irrelevant clutter

-Structured Output – Get clean CSV or JSON files ready for analysis

-Local LLM Integration – Works with Ollama, Llama, or OpenAI models

-Minimal Data Passed to LLMs – Optimized pre-filtering for performance

-Streamlit UI – Simple and fast frontend interface
